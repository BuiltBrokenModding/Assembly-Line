### History

Assembly Line was a mod created in the early days of Minecraft. The orginal concept started off as a prototype for conveyor belts by calcalvia. After it was created the prototype was given to ElusiveHawks. Nothing really happened at this point until the mod was traded off to DarkGuardsman. At this point the mod was given its name and development started on the mod in full. This is were inserter belts were added, along with rejectors plus a few other useful tools and several systems to handle inventories. 

Due to time issues calclavia and Briman0094 were brought into the project. Both worked hard on the mod adding several additional features and blocks. This included robotic arm, crate, filter, and press. All though the work was good and the mod was progressing it came to an end due to internal conflict. Which results in the developers spliting up and mod stagnating for a while. It was eventually merged into Resonant Induction and only recently revived again as a standalone mod.
