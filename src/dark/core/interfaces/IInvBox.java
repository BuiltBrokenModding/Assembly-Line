/** External inventory management container for an object. Allows for most if not all inventory code
 * to be removed from the tile. That is some methods will still need to remain in order to work with
 * automation. As well this is not designed to replace the need for IInventory support of a tile but
 * to make it easier to manage. Suggested use it to create a prefab manager for several tiles. Then
 * have those tiles use the prefab as an extermal inventory manager to reduce code size per class.
